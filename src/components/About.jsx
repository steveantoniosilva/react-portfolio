            During covid I lost my job, I lost my apartment, and I lost my
            father, but what I found was greater meaning and deeper purpose. Out
            of difficulty & struggle only what matters most remains; faith,
            family, grit & determination.

            A couple days after being laid off I was listening to a podcast by
            Quincy Larson on learning to code during the pandemic. I dove in
            head first and never looked back. Two years later, I'm ready to
            pursue this passion full-time.
